# Muon-Lifetime-Experiment

## Summary
A single cylindrical scintillator, together with a PMT were used to detect decays of muons produced in atmosphere. Times between muon entering the detector and decaying were plotted as a histogram and an exponential fit was performed to find the muon lifetime. From this, the positive muon lifetime was found to be $` \tau^+ = (2.2 \pm 0.3) \mu s `$. The Fermi coupling constant was obtained as $` \frac{G_F}{(hc)^3} = (1.16 \pm 0.08) 10^{-5} GeV^{-2} `$
