# Muon-Lifetime-Experiment

Abstract – A single cylindrical scintillator together with a PMT were used to detect decays of muons produced in the atmosphere. Times between muon entering the detector and decaying were plotted as a histogram and an exponential  fit was performed to find the muon lifetime. From it, the positive muon lifetime was calculated to be \mathbit{\tau}^+=\ \left(\mathbf{2}.\mathbf{2}\pm\mathbf{0}.\mathbf{3}\right)\ \mathbit{\mu s}. The Fermi coupling constant was obtained as
 GFħc3=1.16±0.08 10-5 GeV-2. Various properties of the fit were investigated, such as its dependance on number of bins chosen for the histogram.
