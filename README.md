# Muon-Lifetime-Experiment

## Summary
A single cylindrical scintillator, together with a PMT were used to detect decays of muons produced in atmosphere. Times between muon entering the detector and decaying were plotted as a histogram and an exponential fit was performed to find the muon lifetime. From this, the positive muon lifetime was found to be $` \tau^+ = (2.2 \pm 0.3) \mu s `$. The Fermi coupling constant was obtained as $` \frac{G_F}{(\hbar c)^3} = (1.16 \pm 0.08) 10^{-5}  GeV^{-2} `$. Various properties of fit were investigated, such as its dependance on number of bins chosen for the histogram.

## Introduction

A muon is one of the elementary particles, it often can be treated as an unstable, much heavier electron. Muons have an electric charge of -1e and spin 1/2, their antiparticle - antimuons, have +1e electric charge. According to the sign of their charge, muons and antimuona are also referred to as negative and positive muons respectively, and are denoted as $` \mu^- `$ and $`\mu^+ `$. Muons are produced in Earth's atmosphere, as a result of cosmic radiation colliding with air molecules. Muons are unstable, they decay, and negative muons can also disappear through a process called muon capture. Muon decay and processes are: 
$$ \mu^_ \rightarrow e^_ + \bar{v_e} + v_{\mu} $$
